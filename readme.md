## MVC for Sprint 2

### Sprint 2 Goals

The primary focus of Sprint 2 is to develop the Cities component and enhance the overall user experience. The following features and tasks are planned for this sprint:

1. Backend Setup:

    - Develop the server to handle API requests from the frontend.
    - Set up a database to store city information.
    - Create a "cities" collection in the database to store city data.
    - Design the City model, including properties such as name, photo link, and country.
    - Implement routes and controllers for different CRUD operations, including loading, getting all, getting by ID, modifying, and deleting cities.
    - Ensure the backend is functional and can be interacted with using tools like Insomnia/Postman.
